# :.Sum.:
__Raylib Forever__ is a fully automated [Nim](http://nim-lang) includefiles provider for [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and associated libraries.  
Developed in pure frustration it was designed to counterweight other **4** attempts to make actual wrapper.

# :.Featur√¶.:
* Uses sheer power of your browser (and thought) to deliver includes for latest existing version.
* Faithful code conversion: enums to enums, all naming conventions staying as-is.
* Only known Nim binding to wrap [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) (linked as pre-compiled [lib](https://github.com/Guevara-chan/Raylib-Forever/releases/tag/aux)).
* Standalone converter [script](https://gist.github.com/Guevara-chan/2d10691e0146aae4c96ff534978529f8) in [CoffeeScript 2](http://coffeescript.org/), usable under [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* [rlgl](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rlgl.h) module support.

# :.Compatibility.:
__Raylib Forever__ webpage was best tested with *Chrome 80* and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), which is used to develop it.  
It should work on any non-mechanical teapot that provides `fetch` and ES2019, though.
