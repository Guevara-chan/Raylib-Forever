# :.Sum.:
__Raylib Forever__ is a fully automated [Nim](http://nim-lang) includefiles provider for [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and associated libraries.  
Developed in pure frustration it was designed to counterweight other **4** attempts to make actual wrapper.

# :.Featur√¶.:
* Uses sheer power of your browser (and thought) to deliver includes for latest exsiting version.
* Faithful code conversion: enums to enums, all naming conventions staying as-is.
* Only known Nim binding to wrap [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) (linked against pre-compiled [lib](https://github.com/Guevara-chan/Raylib-Forever/releases/tag/aux)
